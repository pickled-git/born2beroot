**Project goal:** To set up a personal server by creating a virtual machine and implementing strict guidelines for system administration and security.
## Mandatory
For the mandatory part, we should:

1. Be able to choose between two of the most well-known Linux-based operating systems: Rocky or Debian;
2. Create LVM partitions to our new VM OS;
3. Ensure SSH services to be running on specific ports;
4. Configure a UFW firewall;
5. Set-up the hostname and a strong password policy for all users;
6. Set-up a strong configuration for the sudo group;
7. Create a monitoring script that displays some specific information every 10 minutes.
## Bonus
For the bonus part we should:

1. Set up a different memory partitioning;
2. Set up a functional WordPress website with specific services;
3. Set up a service of our own choice - and justify that choice!
